# What is Ada?

Ada  is  a  *simple*  chess  engine.  Intended  to  be  a  final  project  in an
introductory  Java  course, it originally supported basic network play. However,
it was eventually retrofitted to accommodate computer play for further study and
academic credit.

# Usage

Building  and  running  Ada  is  really  easy,  just invoke the following at the
command line:

    $ sbt run

If SBT is installed properly Ada should now be running.
